# Stratification: ensures class proportions (eczema, scabies, etc) are preserved across the splits
# Grouping: ensures that all samples (images) from the same subject_id stay in the same split (prevents data leakage)

# Configuration

train_list_path = "train_subjects.txt"
val_list_path = "val_subjects.txt"
test_list_path = "test_subjects.txt"

# Load CSV

# estrae tutti id unici dei pazienti

# First I build a dictionary that maps each unique diagnosis label 
# to a unique integer index

# Encode labels
label_map = {label: idx for idx, label in enumerate(sorted(labels.unique()))}
# make sure to consider only one row per subject_id. This avoids counting a subject multiple times (since each subject may have multiple images).
df_labels = df.drop_duplicates("subject_id")
# convert the string-based diagnosis labels into their corresponding numeric codes
# using the label_map we just created. This gives us a vector `y` that holds one label per subject.
# `y` will be used as the target for stratified splitting, to preserve class proportions
# across the training and validation sets !!
y = df_labels["conditions_PASSION"].map(label_map)

# First split: dev (80%) vs test (20%)
